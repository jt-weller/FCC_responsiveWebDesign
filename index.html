            <h3>Dr. Borlaug's Life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota with the help of the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Drops out of school due to financial constraints. Works in the Civial Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them... All of this left scars on me."</li>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - Graduates from the University of Minnesota and takes a job in the US Foresty Service</li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years, Margret Gibson. Was laid off from the US Forest Service due to budget cuts. Gains inspiration from Elvin Charles Stakman and returns to school to study under him. Stakman teaches him about breeding prest-resistent plants.</li>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Voluntarily enlists in the military after Perl Harbor, but was rejected. However, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied sciences.</li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> - Turns down a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexicon to head a new platn pathaology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow what twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. Eventually, it provides 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Mitigates mass starvation in Delhi, India by bringing a high-yielding strain of what due to the rapidly expanding population</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps 7 African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yeilds</li>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> - distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that GMO crops are the only way to meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GMO crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetially modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - passes away at the age of 95</li>
            </ul>
